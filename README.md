# DNA Sequence One-Hot Encoding

This Git repository serves as a guide on how to create one-hot encoding vectors for DNA sequences in Python. One-hot encoding is a common technique used in bioinformatics and deep learning to represent DNA sequences for machine learning tasks.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a Python script that demonstrates how to convert DNA sequences into one-hot encoding vectors. One-hot encoding is a binary representation where each DNA base (A, C, G, T) is mapped to a unique binary vector. This encoding is commonly used when working with DNA sequences in machine learning and bioinformatics tasks.
